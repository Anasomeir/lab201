    <p>Through the ongoing troubles and conflicts of the Arab Spring taking place in neighbouring Egypt and Syria, Jordan still enjoys a stable and peaceful environment enviable in the region. It is also a major tourist destination in the Middle East, boasting unique natural wonders, untouched desert landscapes and impressive archaeological sites, a number of which are recognised as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Here are seven of the country’s most impressive highlights.</p>


    <p>
        Petra
Always known to local Bedouins, and first described by a Westerner in the 1800s, Petra’s geological and elaborate rock-cut architecture has made this site a national symbol of the country and an obvious contender to Wonders of the World lists. The city, today Jordan’s leading tourist attraction, was once the capital of the ancient Nabataeans, nestled in a secluded valley and carved out of the sides of rose-colored mountain walls. After walking through a narrow gorge, some 1km long, rocks give way to an opening revealing the biggest attraction here, the facade of the Treasury, or Al Kazneh. Past numerous tombs, an amphitheater and a steep uphill walk is an equally impressive facade, the Monastery, scenically perched above the site.
